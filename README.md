# Niklas' Take Angular, React, Vue

## Angular (judging from years of using)

* **Templates**
* **Typescript**
* CLI + Tooling
* Enterprisy
* Upgradebility
* Router?

## React (judging from a workshop)

* Boilerplate
* no CLI?
* render/generating HTML, JSX/TSX not my cup of tea
* Tooling complicated, many ways to do something?
* More famous
* State Management WTF? (redux etc.)
* how to even get started

## Vue (judging from videos)

* similar to Angular but lighter?
* looks good
* TS support?
* not as mature as Angular?
* Simpler as Angular?
